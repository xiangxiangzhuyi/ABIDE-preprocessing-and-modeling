function [  ] = plot_montion_rotation( data)
% After the realign, we need to check th result. the criterion is that if
% the maximal montion or the maximal rotation over 2, the subject will be
% removed. I have a idea that if just a little volume of a subject cannot
% meet the critertion, maybe the subject could also useful. so in order to
% get a whole view of the montion and rotation, I decide to write the
% function to plot the line chat of a subject realign text file.
